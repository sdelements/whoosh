========================
Whoosh 1.0 release notes
========================

API changes
===========

* Custom Weighting implementations that use the ``final()`` method must now
  set the ``use_final`` attribute to ``True``::
  
  	from whoosh.scoring import BM25F
  
  	class MyWeighting(BM25F):
  		use_final = True
  		
  		def final(searcher, docnum, score):
  			return score + docnum * 10
  			
  This disables the new optimizations, forcing Whoosh to score every matching
  document.

* :class:`whoosh.writing.AsyncWriter` now takes an :class:`whoosh.index.Index`
  object as its first argument, not a callable. Also, the keyword arguments to
  pass to the index's ``writer()`` method should now be passed as a dictionary
  using the ``writerargs`` keyword argument.

Misc
====

* Unit tests should no longer leave directories and files behind.
